✍🏽 Output          : 300


- <h3>Problem - 02: (averageMarks.js)</h3>  
Write a program to calculate the average marks of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Bangla of a student.

➡️ Input:
The first line of the input is the marks if the five subjects mentioned above, respectively.

➡️ Output:
Print the result in 2 decimal places.

✍🏽 Sample Input    : 75.25, 65, 80, 35.45, 99.50  
✍🏽 Output          : 71.04


- <h3>Problem - 03: (combineStrings.js)</h3>  
John's teacher gave him two variables. Each variable contains a string. John's teacher asked him to combine these two strings and print them in one line. Help John to write the program.

➡️ Input:
The first and the second lines of the input contain the strings.

➡️ Output:
Print the result in one line.

✍🏽 Sample Input     : I am going to be || an awesome web developer  
✍🏽 Output           : I am going to be an awesome web developer


- <h3>Problem - 04: (findRemainder.js)</h3>  
Sarah's mother is teaching her Mathematics. She gave Sarah a number and asked her what the remainder would be if she divided the number by 5. Help Sarah write the program.

➡️ Input:
The first line of the input contains the number.

➡️ Output:
Print the remainder.

✍🏽 Sample Input     : 119  
✍🏽 Output           : 4


- <h3>Problem - 05: (arrayPosition.js)</h3>  
You are given an array:  
var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

a) Find the index of 'Banana' and replace 'Banana' with 'Mango'.  
b) Remove 'Orange' and add 'Watermelon'.


- <h3>Problem - 06: (findGrades.js)</h3>  
You and your friends Tom, Jane, Peter and John got their final exam results. Your total score is 85, Tom's total score is 66, Jane's total score is 95, Peter's total score is 56 amd john's total score is 40.

The grading chart is -   
➡️ 80 or above A grade,  
➡️ 60 or above B grade,  
➡️ 50 or above C grade,  
➡️ 40 or above D grade and  
➡️ 39 or above => F grade.

Write a program to find your and your friends' grades using 'if-else'.


- <h3>Problem - 07: (largestNumber.js)</h3>  
You are given three numbers 13, 79 and 45. Write a program that will print the largest number using 'if-else'.


- <h3>Problem - 08: (isosceles.js)</h3>  
You are given a triangle with the sides 9, 8, 9. Write a program to check whether the triangle is Isosceles or not using 'if-else'.  
  
✍🏽 Isosceles => two sides are equal.
